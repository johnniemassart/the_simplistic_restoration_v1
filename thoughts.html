                            <p>while consuming a plant-based diet certainly offers an innumerable number of benefits with regards to physical health, an equally as important realm of well-being relates to that of mental perception. the way in which an individual perceives the world strongly correlates to their ability to manage adversity, failure, in addition to combating malignant pathogens. dr. martin seligman’s book <span class="optimism-title">learned optimism</span> counteracts the ostensibly conceived notion that health remains a wholly physical matter. some fascinating highlights garnered from <span class="optimism-title">learned optimism</span> appear below.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="optimism-header"><h3>optimism vs. pessimism</h3></li>
                                    <p>grasping the startling differences between pessimism and optimism remains crucial before procuring the health benefits of an optimistic way of life. pessimists tend to assume unfortunate events endure forever, impact each aspect of life, and ultimate derive from the self as personal failures. the root phenomena spawning pessimism in individuals stems from the concept of helplessness. life begins in helplessness, with certainly all of us facing moments of helplessness through the course of life. pessimists, unfortunately, comprehend each moment in the realm of life as entirely helpless. optimists, on the other hand, ponder misfortune as temporary and an opportunity to recalibrate. each setback remains confined according to a case-by-case basis, rather than as a gauge to perceive the hierarchy of life.</p>
                                <li class="optimism-header"><h3>explanatory style</h3></li>
                                    <p>the otherwise trivial words and phrases which hastily inundate our thoughts play a significant role in determining specific outlook. these intrinsically held explanations regarding the meaning of events unequivocally determine whether a pessimistic or optimistic outlook engenders. emitting an optimistic explanatory style rebuffs the possibility of helplessness, while pessimistic explanatory style allows for helplessness to burgeon. the three critical components to explanatory style encompass permanence, pervasiveness, and personalization. those which implement qualifiers such as always’s and never’s propagate a pessimistic explanatory style; sometimes’s and lately’s, on the other hand, indicate an optimistic explanatory style. supplanting the former in favor of the latter aids in a person’s resilience to quell pessimisms supreme form, depression. isolating the pervasiveness of faulty events as specific instead of universal begets tremendous control over helplessness. dr. seligman depicts a fascinating nuance to consider, “the optimist believes that bad events have specific causes, while good events will enhance everything he does; the pessimist believes that bad events have universal causes and that good events are caused by specific factors.” the final concept of personalization indicates those with low self-esteem and a pessimistic explanatory style commonly blame themselves amidst strife, whereas optimists with a high self-esteem redirect blame externally. this finding requires a caveat to responsibility, deserving of appropriate rumination: “most assuredly we want people to own up to the messes they make, to be responsible for their actions.” personalization demands flexibility from the individual to grasp a middle-ground between accepting appropriate responsibility, while not gleaning the entire burden of responsibility internally.</p>

                            <p>for the fifth consecutive year, finland tops the globe as the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/" target="_blank">world's happiest country.</a> even more impressive, all five nordic countries of finland, sweden, denmark, norway, and iceland rank inside the top eight. my previous narcissistic behavior, as noted in a prior post, cultivated a desire to understand the various ways in which others achieve organic, intrinsic health. health not defined so simplistic as physical or an extrinsic perception, but rather a meaningful manifestation built to innately empower the members of a society. data from the world happiness report, as well as anu partanen’s <span class="nordic-book">the nordic theory of everything,</span> lends a baseline to grasp the ways in which nordic societies achieve such desirable results.</p>
                            <p>the chart’s created below illustrate nordic countries in red with the united states depicted in blue. finland’s consistent number one ranking, as well as anu partanen’s background growing up in finland specifically, provides the most advantageous nation to compare the united states against. recognize that many of the foundational elements illustrated in finland remain largely ubiquitous throughout the remaining nordic nations as well.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><h3>perception of corruption</h3></li>
                                    <a href="https://github.com/johnniemassart/learning-from-the-nordic-countries/blob/main/Nordic%20vs.%20USA:%20Perception%20of%20Corruption.jpeg" target="_blank"><p>*increased perception of corruption indicates greater trust in the government*</p></a>
                                    <p>the greatest disconnect between the nordic nations and the united states presents itself through the perception of corruption within the government. four of five nordic countries, including finland, appear as outliers to the rest of the dataset where the united states remains clustered. this scatterplot, however, portrays an essential cornerstone of nordic society unavailable to citizens of the united states. access to free (paid for via taxes) health care, education, parental leave, day care, among many other social benefits, remains a foundational aspect of nordic society which ironically many in the united states criticize. the naïve and commonly held assumption by americans remains the notion that those from nordic countries live in a communist society, slaving to the state for these benefits. the difference between the two societies expresses itself in the creation of a “smart” government, rather than the “big” government many americans fear, as noted in <span class="nordic-book">the nordic theory of everything.</span> “the oecd has compared average tax rates for a single individual without children in thirty-four developed countries, including federal and local income taxes, along with an employee’s social security contributions. in 2014, finland came in ninth, at 30.7%... sweden fell under the oecd average with a rate of 24.4 percent – less than the united states, which came in at 24.8 percent.” while many of the nordic countries’ top income tax bracket hovers near 50 percent, this augmented rate only impacts income above a predefined threshold; and for perspective, this top income tax bracket, if utilized in the united states, ought to effect a mere five percent of the population. for perspective, many large cities such as los angeles, new york city, etc. already charge citizens such exacerbated income tax rates. however, the taxes paid by citizens in nordic countries cover massive expenses that those in the united states need to pay independently, entirely separate from the income tax rate. rather than living in some altruistic culture, citizens from nordic countries understand the role in which government, specifically the taxes paid, serve to their direct benefit. the system creates autonomous individuals, unencumbered from depending on employers, family, etc. for benefits like health care, education, among others. the concrete benefits provided to each member in nordic society allows for the fostering of a meaningful and trusting relationship with the government and its people. those in the united states remain bereft from such benefits and thus burdened to cover the almost unrealistic price tag of health care, education, day care, etc., while ironically paying nearly identical income tax rates.</p>
                                <li><h3>gdp per capita</h3></li>
                                    <a href="https://github.com/johnniemassart/learning-from-the-nordic-countries/blob/main/Nordic%20vs.%20USA:%20GDP%20Per%20Capita.jpeg" target="_blank"><p>*increased gdp per capita indicates greater average standard of living for citizens*</p></a>
                                    <p>surely the capitalist, free market economy the united states so proudly displays to the world ought to impact happiness at a much higher rate than the rest of the nordic countries, right? while their certainly appears a linear correlation between happiness and gdp per capita, the average standard of living amongst members of nordic societies and those from the united states remains clustered near the 2.0 mark. all the nordic countries, however, hover above the united states in terms of happiness. this chart first dispels the fallacy of nordic nations as socialist or communist countries. nordic nations progress into the twenty-first century implementing many aspects of capitalistic, free-market countries, much like that of the united states. the more prominent difference between the two societies stems from the governments management of taxes, as noted previously. the standard of living in nordic countries remains similar to that of the united states despite the possibility of slightly higher taxes. contrary to prevalent american attitude, and certainly my prior perspective, happiness fails to derive from personal wealth. anu partanen notes, “what motivates people is actually their relative wealth compared to with others, not their absolute wealth, and other factors such as their status, sense of accomplishment, and relative quality of life.” the wealth disparity in the united states professes itself profoundly in understanding that “between 2009 and 2012, the top 1 percent in america captured more than 90 percent of the entire country’s gain in income.” i certainly recognize and appreciate the capitalistic mentality embedded in american culture for which it drives creation and ingenuity. this capitalistic approach to accumulate wealth, however, fails to correlate with happiness. those that succeed monetarily in american society bridge the vast inequality gap to those without the same fortunes. nordic society certainly restricts the ability for individuals to achieve such poignant wealth. yet, by ensuring society with fundamentals those in the united states remain encumbered to provide independently, a sense of freedom and happiness ensues.</p>
                                <li><h3>generosity</h3></li>
                                    <a href="https://github.com/johnniemassart/learning-from-the-nordic-countries/blob/main/Nordic%20vs.%20USA:%20Generosity.jpeg" target="_blank"><p>*increased generosity indicates greater optimism and generosity towards others*</p></a>
                                    <p>a compelling aspect of finnish culture, a seeming paradox to the rudimentary understanding of happiness, stems from finland’s results regarding generosity. while finns rank number one in happiness, they perform modest at best in terms of generosity with even the united states outshining them. these results highlight the distorted myth of immense altruism within nordic societies, but more specifically finland, to obtain benefits like health care, education, parental leave, etc. according to anu partanen, the finnish stereotype depicting their negative disposition continues to thrive. “my finnish friends who’ve lived in the united states and then returned to finland find that one of the most difficult things to bear back in finland is negativity.” the optimism permeated throughout the united states, one that accentuates on achieving the american dream, certainly ought to aid in happiness, correct? interestingly, gabriele oettingen from nyu states, “the more optimistic each person had been about his or her outcomes, the worse the results… positive thinking can fool our minds into perceiving that we’ve already attained our goal, which slackens our readiness to pursue it.” the pervasive and unrealistic sense of optimism present in american culture stunts individual happiness. rather than accept contemporary inequalities with a sense of optimism, finns grasp a more realistic approach to generosity and optimism, ultimately allowing them to yield necessary progress. additionally, the overly optimistic sentiment that each person holds the capacity to obtain the american dream inflicts tremendous pressure to achieve success. the affection for super achievers in american society unfortunately conceives narcissistic, despondent individuals understanding their value as nothing more than their achievements. finnish culture, on the other hand, respects each individual regardless of their achievements. this appreciation for the individual on a personal level eradicates narcissism and cultivates organic happiness.</p>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="nordic-conclusion">while happiness ultimately remains unique to the individual, the nuances seen in nordic culture aid in cultivating an augmented societal perception of self. autonomous individuals not confined to dependence on their employers or family for twenty-first necessities allow for the liberty the united states founded itself upon. by understanding the ways in which the government works in the individuals favor, these desirable benefits remain possible to obtain without a collapse of independence or requiring an overarching altruistic mentality. eliminating the american societal lust for super achievers remains doubtful; however, learning to value yourself and others beyond achievements, wealth, etc. remains paramount in the attaining organic, intrinsic health.</p>

                                <li><h3>connecting the dots</h3></li>
                                    <p>“you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. you have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.”</p>
                                <li><h3>love and loss</h3></li>
                                    <p>“sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. don’t lose faith. i’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did. you’ve got to find what you love.”</p>
                                <li><h3>death</h3></li>
                                    <p>“your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. they somehow already know what you truly want to become.”</p>
                            </ol>
                            <p>three stories intertwined in one commencement address: connecting the dots, love and loss, and death. yet, amidst the ostensible lack of cohesion, a prominent theme emerges → chasing your innate purpose regardless of the outside noise. an individual’s ikigai remains intrinsically unique, unattainable by any other person. society too often hastily rejects passions and dreams as nothing more than hobbies, hindering creation in favor of a purported sense of safety and security in following the well-worn path. unfortunately, this flawed perspective prevents valuable innovation while engendering widespread communal apathy.</p>
                            <p>the greatest challenge to any endeavor undoubtedly remains the first step. as noted, to connect the dots, a willingness to trust yourself needs to present itself. cultivating this inner belief takes inexorable practice, requiring a desire to welcome criticism and doubt. a worthwhile journey, however, always produces invaluable insight regardless of whether each step directly impacts the sought outcome. this openness to experience induces a diverse panoply of original thought to imbue further individual growth while the vast array of dots continue to connect.</p>
                            <p>embrace failure, humility, and rejection along this odyssey. the bricks thrown by life occur regardless of whether you trust your own gut enough to follow it or decide to suffocate your aspirations in accordance with contemporary herd mentality. the way in which an individual grapples disappointment depends on each person’s appetite for stomaching failure as a necessary step towards progress. striving towards a deep-rooted purpose allows for the capacity to endure unimaginable setbacks. these obstacles, ironically, only further entrench a love to keep pushing forward despite the possibility of loss.</p>
                            <p>follow yourself, not the voice of others. when the feared reality of death inevitably emerges, all insecurities suddenly vanquish. will others join you? with another person take your place instead? each of us ultimately needs to recognize the frank reality that our existence remains independent of any other person. value yourself, unbridle the façade, and follow your intuition. the path enlightens to those willing to embark on the uncertain, but vastly fulfilling journey.</p>
                            <p>“stay hungry. stay foolish.”</p>

                            <p>this <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/health/longer-life-diet-wellness/index.html" target="_blank">cnn</a> article highlights the growing evidence regarding the way in which dietary choices either deleteriously or auspiciously impact the health of the body, as seen through longevity. simply replacing known carcinogenic food items, which remain prominent in the standard western diet, such as red meat and processed foods, in favor of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts increases longevity innumerably.</p>
                            <p>moving away from the standard western diet to a plant-based or mediterranean diet and its direct influence on lifespan, in years:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- transform diet at age 20 (male) → lifespan increase of 13 years</li>
                                <li>- transform diet at age 20 (female) → lifespan increase of 10 years</li>
                                <li>- transform diet at age 60 (male) → lifespan increase of 9 years</li>
                                <li>- transform diet at age 60 (female) → lifespan increase of 8 years</li>
                                <li>- transform diet at age 80 (male) → lifespan increase of 3.5 years</li>
                                <li>- transform diet at age 80 (female) → lifespan increase of 3.5 years</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>as the data suggests, despite years of burden with toxic substances, the body remains malleable in adapting to its current environment. this notion of malleability within the body touches on the salience of the microbiome and its ability to evolve accordingly to one’s influences, most notably the individual’s dietary choices. a study from the university of california san francisco, as depicted in super genes, sought to identify the speed in which in the microbiome transforms depending on diet. one portion of the mice selected in the study ate a vegan diet, while the other portion consumed foods similar to that seen in the standard western diet. “when the animals then switched from the vegan to the junk food diet, the host of intestinal microbes changed within three days regardless of the genetics of the mice used.” the results produced in this ucsf study provide a baseline understanding as to how, regardless of age and previous exposure to toxins, the body remains adaptive to quickly reversing or contributing to disease depending on the types of bacteria flourishing in the microbiome.</p>
                            <p>similar to the findings expressed in the blue zones solution, the article denotes legumes as the most profound contributor to longevity. legumes’ distinction as a staple of longevity coinciding with its significant presence in latin and south american cuisine, provides insight as to how citizens in these countries outlive american’s, on average. a diet centered around beans and rice, as seen in the blue zone of nicoya peninsula, costa rica, produces 2.5 times more men reaching the age of ninety, compared to those in the united states. most importantly, nicoyan’s spend roughly “…1/15th of what the united states spends on health care.”</p>

                            <p>similar to daoism, veganism connects the individual directly back with the organic domain. society needs to emphasize assimilating plant-based foods into the modern diet, such as: fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, sprouts, and grains. this paradigm shift impacting the present-day diet, interestingly, encompasses a wide range of additional social concerns concurrently. raging wildfires, severe drought, chronic disease and illness, ethical implications, as well as a host of supplementary concerns that continue to plague the globe, directly stem from the consumption of animal products.</p>
                            <p>by enforcing wu wei as a guiding principle into daily habit, the inaction of failing to consume animal products generates instant positive actions from inside your body, as well as outside around the globe. regrowth from the harmful toxins emitted daily, decreased global emissions, augmented microbiome diversity to combat chronic illnesses, reduced reliance on medical and pharmaceutical intervention, etc. the path towards a more simplistic natural reality, ironically, originates through “without action” → wu wei.</p>

                            <p>beyond ethic and social concerns, living a plant-based lifestyle statistically boosts longevity, as seen in <span class="blue-zones-book">the blue zones solution.</span> the five blue zones depicted center food choices around whole plant-based foods, grown locally and without pesticides and/or herbicides. the individuals in these societies garner a deep appreciation for the food eaten, given the arduous labor required to attain such goods. the environment where these blue zone cities find themselves nested in foster a robust style of living. in stark contrast to the sickening westernized american diet, those living in the blue zones “…never read labels, counted calories, weighed their protein, or signed up for weight watchers. yet they all ate a nearly perfect diet without thinking about it” (83). listed below illustrates the biggest takeaways from each blue zone.</p>

                            <p>with the deadly effects of covid-19 emphasized on a daily basis since its conception, its correlation to food consumption seemingly remained concealed. medical experts failed to illustrate the necessity for globalized society to drastically alter the omnipresent hazardous eating standards. while people across the globe decimated supplies of hand sanitizer, antibacterial wipes, toilet paper, canned foods, etc., fruits and vegetables remained largely untouched. as greek physician hippocrates famously declared, “let thy food by thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” this assertion finds itself deeply intertwined with the data presented above. many african countries, with limited financial means to proper medical access, produced some of the highest survival rates in the world. europe and the united states, on the other hand, found themselves entangled in a serious battle with lofty death rates. as darin olien indicates in <span class="superlife-book">superlife,</span> “people in underdeveloped countries understand that food has healing powers → if you can’t afford or don’t have access to drugs to treat illness, it becomes extremely important to eat in a way that prevents it.” building a robust microbiome that allows the immune system to function properly in fighting infections and diseases ought to become the focal point. important to note, many african countries with low death rates yield the greatest amounts of vegetable product consumption, while maintaining the lowest amounts of animal product consumption. europe and the united states, however, follow the standard westernized diet that include increased animal product consumption, and minimal vegetable product consumption. darin emphatically declares, “we don’t catch a cold – we create the conditions through our tendencies to either welcome or repel the illness → sickness is often a result of a choice we made.” next time you walk the isles of the grocery store, consider spending an additional few minutes in the produce section.</p>
